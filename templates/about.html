        <p>Hello, I'm Ayush a web developer. I ❤️chai,</p>
        <img class="mountain" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/d8tkB4uvd7v2o95bfK/giphy.gif">
        <p>I am from Dehradun, a small city situated near the Himalayan foothills.</p>
        <p>One day an idea pop-up into my head about sharing some random things with people, so I ended up making this blog. Hope you'll like it.</p>
        <p>I'm just an ordinary person, I usually spend my day sitting with my laptop, while having a cup of tea by my side. And taking my dogs for a walk in the evening.</p>
        <p>But my best skill is actually in drinking tea. I get charged up by it in the morning.Ginger tea is my favourite!</p>
        <p>If you too wanna make a blog post or in case you want a website. Then feel free to <a href="{{url_for('contact')}}">contact me.</a></p>
        <p>Also you can checkout a small and interesting website, which I built few months ago. <a href="https://young-ravine-25884.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"> Take me there.</a></p>
